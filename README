ProxyField
==========

ProxyField provied the ability to proxy an ActiveRecord column or columns through
another object. 


Example
=======
You store time duration in seconds in ActiveRecord column called "duration".
Lets say your model is called WaitingRoom. If you wanted to get the hours from an 
instance of the model you would have

w = WaitingRoom.find(CONDITIONS)
w.duration / 60 / 60 # to get the hours

ProxyField would allow you to easily override the default return value of the call
to duration with another object.  It will create an instance of your wrapper object 
with the columns value as its constructor parameter.

class DurationField
  def initialize(seconds)
	  @seconds = seconds
	end

  def to_hours
    @seconds / 60 / 60
  end

  # more methods on the proxy here
  # to_seconds, to_minutes, to_days
  # to_weeks, to_years, etc...
end

class WaitingRoom < ActiveRecord::Base
  proxy_field :duration, :as => DurationField
	# Also valid
	# proxy_field [:col1, :col2], :as => ProxyObj
end

Now I can say:
w = WaitingRoom.find(CONDITIONS)
w.to_hours
